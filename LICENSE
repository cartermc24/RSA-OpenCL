 This code was modified and integrated by Carter McCardwell of Northeastern University NUCAR 2015
 for the project CasRSA_CL
 MODIFICATIONS:
    - Removed recursion
    - Rewrote sections to be compatible with OpenCL
    - Allow initialization of bignum using cstrings
    - Added modulus operator
    - Added pow operator
    - Fixed a few bugs when porting to GPU
    - Addition of function bignum_fme_modpow which implements
      a version of FME mod optimizations to the library for NUCAR testing
      purposes.
